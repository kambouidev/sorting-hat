## Introduction 📚

In this web application, users will go through a chat-like experience where they answer questions posed by the Sorting Hat. Based on their responses, the app will calculate a matching score for each Hogwarts house (Gryffindor 🦁, Hufflepuff 🦡, Ravenclaw 🦅, Slytherin 🐍) and determine the house that best suits the user's personality. 🧙‍♀️📖


## Presentation 🪄

- The app is designed to resemble a chat application. 💬📱
- Questions and answers are animated for a smooth user experience. 🔄🎉
- The chat interface accommodates variable-sized questions and answers. 📏🧾
- Users can scroll through the conversation, and new messages scroll smoothly into view. 📜🚀
